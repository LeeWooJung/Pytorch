Sequence to Sequence(Seq2Seq) implementation using Pytorch
=========================================================

This model translate from English to Korean using Seq2Seq(LSTM or GRU).  
This model totally follows the code from https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/1%20-%20Sequence%20to%20Sequence%20Learning%20with%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb  
But there is a few changes, since library 'spacy' doesn't have Korean tokenizer.


Version Control
=========================================================
* torch: 1.5.1
* torchtext: 0.6.0
* numpy: 1.18.5
